    The music i love the most is Nigerian music because it makes
    me connect back to my root we have different musicians 
    like Davido, Kiss Daniel, wizkid, Teckno, Flavor, Dare, Olamide.
    The artist i love his song the most is Olamide. 
    I love his selection because i can relate to his music 
    and it makes me feel that the song is about me the music 
    makes me see the  richness of my culture and assurance that
    with determination, you can achieve whatever you want in lif
